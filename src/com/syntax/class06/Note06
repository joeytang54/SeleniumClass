Alerts:
Alerts is a pop up message.
Alert takes a complete focus of our main page that we are working on
We cannot proceed until it is handled

3 types of Alerts:
1) web based alerts/ html alerts - we can simply inspect and perform need actions
2) Javascript alerts/ browser alerts - we can handle these alerts by using switchTo method
                                        we cannot inspect
3) windows based alerts - we cannot handle with Selenium

Types of JS alerts:
1) Simple alert - click OK
2) Confirmation alert - either cancel or click ok
3) prompt alert - enter the text and then click ok or cancel

To handle JS alerts we only have 4 methods:
1) accept() - click ok
2) dismiss() - click cancel
3) getText()
4) sendKeys()

To handle authentication alerts we need to pass username and password in the URL
e.g. "https://admin:admin@the-internet.herokuapp.com/basic_auth";
     //username:password@

Frames
Frames is a separate independent window in our webpage
Frame allow devs to represent multiple views on one page
3 Ways to interact with Frames:
1) by index
2) by name or ID
3) by WebElement

in alerts - switch to alert and switch automatically back
in frames - switch to a frame manually and switch manually back to the main page
